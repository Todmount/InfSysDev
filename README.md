### Overview

The Development Information System is designed to streamline the process of receiving, storing, and managing applications. The web-based form simplifies the application submission process, while the backend system handles storage and history tracking.

### Branches

The project is organized into branches, each representing a part corresponding to a laboratory in the university curriculum. The branches are as follows:

1. `Lab_1`: Develop web interface elements using HTML forms.
2. `Lab_2`: Create a dynamic web interface using JavaScript and the DOM object model.
3. `Lab_3`: Build an interactive web interface using AJAX technology.
4. `Labs-4&5`: Develop a client-server web application using HTML forms and server scripts (PHP).

Each branch corresponds to a specific stage of development and is merged into the main branch upon completion.

### Getting Started
