### Overview

The system is designed to streamline the process of receiving, storing, and managing applications. The web-based form simplifies the application submission process, while the backend system handles storage and history tracking.

### Branches

The project development stages is organized into branches, each representing a part corresponding to a laboratory in the university curriculum. The branches are as follows:

1. `Lab_1`: Develop web interface elements using HTML forms.
2. `Lab_2`: Create a dynamic web interface using JavaScript and the DOM object model.
3. `Lab_3`: Build an interactive web interface using AJAX technology.
4. `Labs_4&5`: Develop a client-server web application using HTML forms and server scripts (PHP).

Each branch is merged into the main branch upon completion.

### Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/development-information-system.git
   ```

   Switch to the branch corresponding to the laboratory part you want to explore (optional):

   ```bash
   git checkout branch_name
   ```

2. Start a local development server (assuming you have PHP installed):

   ```bash
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000 to view the lab's application.
